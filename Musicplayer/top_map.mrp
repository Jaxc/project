    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     363 out of     363 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     363   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         676 out of   3,584   18%
    Number used as logic:               648
    Number used as a route-thru:         28

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.57

Peak Memory Usage:  209 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  13 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   5 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:110 - output buffer 'MemCLKOut_OBUF' driving design level port
   'MemCLKOut' is being pushed into module 'Inst_SDRAMInterface' to enable I/O
   register usage. The buffer has been renamed as
   'Inst_SDRAMInterface/MemCLKOut_OBUF'.
INFO:Map:110 - output buffer 'errorcode_0_OBUF' driving design level port
   'errorcode<0>' is being pushed into module 'Inst_controlunit' to enable I/O
   register usage. The buffer has been renamed as
   'Inst_controlunit/errorcode_0_OBUF'.
INFO:Map:110 - output buffer 'errorcode_1_OBUF' driving design level port
   'errorcode<1>' is being pushed into module 'Inst_controlunit' to enable I/O
   register usage. The buffer has been renamed as
   'Inst_controlunit/errorcode_1_OBUF'.
INFO:Map:110 - output buffer 'errorcode_2_OBUF' driving design level port
   'errorcode<2>' is being pushed into module 'Inst_controlunit' to enable I/O
   register usage. The buffer has been renamed as
   'Inst_controlunit/errorcode_2_OBUF'.
INFO:Map:110 - output buffer 'errorcode_3_OBUF' driving design level port
   'errorcode<3>' is being pushed into module 'Inst_controlunit' to enable I/O
   register usage. The buffer has been renamed as
   'Inst_controlunit/errorcode_3_OBUF'.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   6 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic reported below is either:
   1. part of a cycle
   2. part of disabled logic
   3. a side-effect of other trimmed logic

The signal "modeselect<1>" is unused and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		Inst_SDRAMInterface/XST_GND
VCC 		Inst_SDRAMInterface/XST_VCC
GND 		Inst_SampleENA/XST_GND
VCC 		Inst_SampleENA/XST_VCC
GND 		Inst_controlunit/XST_GND
VCC 		Inst_controlunit/XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
